<h3>Boolean True or false, with If statement condition</h3>

function trueOrFalse(wasThatTrue) { <br>
  // Only change code below this line.

  if (wasThatTrue) { <br>
    return "Yes, that was true"; <br>
  }
  return "No, that was false"; <br>

  // Only change code above this line.br
}

console.log(trueOrFalse(true));

</p>

<p>
The function first evaluates if the condition (wasThatTrue)
 evaluates to true. If it does, ir returns the statement
  between the curly braces. If it doesnâ€™t, it returns 
  the next return statement outside them</p>

    <h3>Comparison operators in JavaScript.</h3> 
    
    <p> All of these operators return a boolean true or false value.
    The most basic operator is the <span> equality operator = =.</span> 
    The equality operator compares two values and returns true 
    if they're equivalent or false if they are not. </p>
    
    Note that equality is different from  <span> assignment (=, =+, =- etc),</span>
     which assigns the value on the right of the operator 
     to a variable on the left.


<p>In order for JavaScript to compare two 
different data types (for example, numbers and strings), 
it must convert one type to another. 
This is known as Type Coercion. Once it does, however, 
it can compare terms as follows:</p>
<br>

1   = =  1  // true <br>
1   = =  2  // false <br>
1   = = '1' // true <br>
"3" = =  3  // true <br>

    <h3>Comparison btw Equality and Strict Equality Operator</h3> 
Strict equality (===) is the counterpart to
 the equality operator (==). 
 However, unlike the equality operator, 
which attempts to convert both values being compared to
 a common type, 
 the strict equality operator does not 
 perform a type conversion.

If the values being compared have different types, 
they are considered unequal, and the strict equality 
operator will return false.

Examples

3 ===  3  // true <br>
3 === '3' // false <br>
In the second example, 3 is a Number type 
and '3' is a String type.
